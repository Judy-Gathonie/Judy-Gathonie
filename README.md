🚀 About Me
<ins>I’m a Backend Engineer and Cloud Enthusiast</ins> passionate about building scalable systems and seamless cloud infrastructure. My work is driven by the belief that technology should make processes more efficient and accessible, especially in areas like healthcare.

Currently, I’m working on a healthcare diagnostics project focused on early detection of breast cancer, aiming to make diagnostics both affordable and efficient. I’m always looking for new ways to grow and improve, whether it’s diving into AWS services, automating tasks with Jenkins, or refining my Linux skills.

🔧 Skills & Tools
<ins>I enjoy working across a wide range of technologies, which include:</ins>

Languages: I write code in Python, Java, and Bash, using each where they shine the most.
Cloud Platforms: I’m proficient in AWS services like EC2, S3, Lambda, and RDS, and I use Terraform to manage infrastructure as code.
DevOps Tools: My DevOps toolkit includes Jenkins for CI/CD, Docker for containerization, and Ansible for automation. I’m constantly exploring new ways to automate workflows.
Databases: I work with relational databases such as MySQL and PostgreSQL, designing efficient data storage and retrieval systems.
Operating Systems: I’m a Linux enthusiast, leveraging its powerful command-line interface to manage systems and environments.
🛠 What I’m Working On
<ins>I’m currently focused on a few key areas:</ins>

Cloud infrastructure: I’m building scalable cloud environments that can handle growth while maintaining reliability.
Backend systems: I’m optimizing backend performance to ensure faster and more efficient processing.
Code optimization: My goal is to write not just functional code, but optimized, clean, and maintainable code that stands the test of time.

🌍 Let’s Collaborate
<ins>I’m always eager to collaborate on projects that push the boundaries of what technology can do.</ins> If you have an interesting cloud or backend project, let’s connect! I’m particularly interested in working on initiatives that align with healthcare, artificial intelligence, or environmental solutions, as I believe technology can and should be a force for good in the world.

💬 Fun Fact
<ins>When I’m not immersed in code, you’ll likely find me sipping coffee at a cozy café ☕ or experimenting with different Linux distros 🐧.</ins> I’m also a fan of automating everything in my daily life—because why not?
